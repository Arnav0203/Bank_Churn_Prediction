# Bank_Churn_Prediction
Created a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, analyze key contributing factors, segment high-risk customers, in order to develop targeted retention strategies.

**Summary:**
We used predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Lasso Regression) and found that Random Forest provided the best performance based on the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric, effectively predicting churn probabilities. Some key indicators influencing churn are age, geography, credit score, tenure, number of products, and customer activity status. Using the cost-benefit matrix, we found that the bank would optimize profit by reaching out to everyone with a predicted churn > 0.56.
